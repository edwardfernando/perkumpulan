# Association (Legal Entity)

Hi All,

This is an update from the organizer team about **Rubyconf 2017** and our Community.

So, as already announced during the last meetup, Rubyconf 2017 will be postponed to **October 2017**. This is because more time is needed to prepare for our first international event. Other than that, We also gonna need sizeable number of resources including manpower and funding. Fortunately there have been some companies that are willing to provide support for us.

At the current stage, then a question arises: **Into which bank account funds from the sponsor will be transferred?**

Taking into consideration: professionality, financial transparency and to convince prospective sponsors that all money that we receive will only be used for the benefit of the community, we then decided to establish **a not-for-profit legal entity**.

To create a legal entity requires a fee and the fee is assumed to be around IDR 10 million. The fee will be used for the following purposes:
- notary fees
- virtual office fee for domicile (mandatory for deed & npwp) - first year
- other costs (transport, etc.)

Therefore, we from the organizer team decided to do a fund-raising by opening the membership for the legal entity of our association. The steps to become an official member is as follow:
- Register at http://ruby.id/daftar
- Transfer new member fee to:
  - 116-000-4376670
  - a.n. GIOVANNI SAKTI NUGRAHA
  - Bank Mandiri RS Harapan Kita
  - Write down your full name on the transfer receipt
- Send transfer receipt and photocopy of your ID card to membership@ruby.id
- The new member fee amounted to 220,000, then there will be annual donation of 120,000 / year
- The new member fee already includes annual donation for the first year
- New members will get an id-ruby t-shirt (3 month delivery estimate after legal entity created)
- Special programs for members of the association

The official name of the legal entity is as follows:  
id: **PERKUMPULAN PENGRAJIN KODE INDONESIA (PERKODI)**  
en: *INDONESIA CODE CRAFTER SOCIETY*

The use of generic names is intentional to make the legal entity more flexible and able to cooperate with other communities.

If there are any further questions, you may read the F.A.Q, which I provided below or contact membership@ruby.id or through id-ruby slack

Thank You and we will be waiting for your participation :)

Note:
- Registration will remain open throughout the year, but only those who register & transfer before 28 May 23.59 pk will be considered as a founding member because we have to register to the notary ASAP
- If for one reason or another the association is failed to be established, the money will be refunded

# F.A.Q

- Why form a legal entity?
    - Can create a bank account to receive sponsorship fund & Rubyconf tickets (most important reason right now, please note that sponsors generally don't want to transfer sponsorship fund to individual bank accounts)
    - Can receive member officially & accommodate membership fee for mutual benefit
    - Stabilizes the source of income to pay for annual expenses of id-ruby, including:
      - ruby.id domain
      - meetup.com subscription
      - Increase the certainty of meetup (independent meetup)
      - virtual office for legal entities per year

- Why are legal entities in the form of associations?
    - If we look at the official definition: * Association is a legal entity which is a collection of people established to realize the similarity of certain intent and purpose in the field of social, religious, and humanitarian and not sharing profit to its members *
    - It is concluded that the association is a not-for-profit legal entity, so we can better convince sponsors to contribute to our events and also increase the opportunity to participate in corporate CSR programs.

- How do I become a member?

  - New members will get an id-ruby t-shirt (3 month delivery estimate after legal entity created)

- What are the benefits of being a member?

  - The events in question include: meetup (hopefully not only in Jakarta), international conferences, workshops
  - Supports the creation of Rubyconf 2017, Ruby International Conference
